        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <ul><li>In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. </li>
            <li>He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.</li>
            <li>During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times.</li>
            <li>When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from brands.</li>
            <li>He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales internationally.</li>
            <li>He also conceptualized and spearheaded the development of the Tata Nano car, which helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.</li>
            <li>Tata Motors has since rolled out the first batch of Tigor Electric Vehicles from its Sanand Plant in Gujarat, which Tata has described as "fast-forward[ing] India's electric dream."</li>
